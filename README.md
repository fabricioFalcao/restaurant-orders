# Restaurant Menu Tool Project

During this project, I was tasked with finalizing a menu-building tool for the üçù ü¶ê Chapa Quente üçõ ü•ò restaurant. The tool needed to generate menus while considering dietary restrictions and ingredient availability in stock. The restaurant's recipe and inventory management were currently inefficiently handled using CSV files, prompting the founders to improve this process.

## Skills Developed

- Practiced the concept of Hashmaps using Python's Dict and Set data structures.
- Applied software testing knowledge to ensure robust and reliable code.
- Enhanced object-oriented programming skills.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project were to enhance the menu-generation process by implementing new features and classes within an existing codebase. I focused on building clean, maintainable, and readable code while adhering to best practices.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Leveraged Python to implement new classes and functionalities.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Implemented classes for mapping dishes and their recipes, generating menus, and managing ingredient stock.
- **Data Structures**: Utilized Dict and Set for efficient data management.
- **Software Testing**: Developed comprehensive tests to ensure code reliability and functionality.
- **Code Quality**: Emphasized clean code practices to improve maintainability and readability.

This project allowed me to apply and enhance my Python programming skills, particularly in the context of object-oriented design and software testing, while addressing real-world requirements for a restaurant menu management tool.
